   <p id = "first"><b><big>About his life -</big></b> Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta (name shortened to Narendra or Naren) in a Bengali family in his 
                       ancestral home at 3 Gourmohan Mukherjee Street in Calcutta, the capital of British India, on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival.
                       He belonged to a traditional family and was one of nine siblings. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the Calcutta High Court.
                       Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's grandfather was a Sanskrit and Persian scholar who left his family and became a monk at age twenty-five.
                       His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife. The progressive, rational attitude of Narendra's father and the religious temperament 
                       of his mother helped shape his thinking and personality. Narendranath was interested in spirituality from a young age and used to meditate 
                       before the images of deities such as Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir Hanuman.</p><br><br>

  <p id = "second"><b><big>His education -</big></b> In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution, where he went to school until his family
                      moved to Raipur in 1877. In 1879, after his family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the Presidency 
                      College entrance examination. He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, religion, history, social science, art and
                      literature. He was also interested in Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and 
                      the Puranas. Narendra was trained in Indian classical music, and regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and organised activities.
                      Narendra studied Western logic, Western philosophy and European history at the General Assembly's Institution.In 1881, he passed the Fine Arts
                      examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884.</p><br><br>

 <p id = "third"><b><big>His spiritual journey -</big></b> In 1881, Narendra first met Ramakrishna, who became his spiritual focus after his own father had died in 1884.Narendra's first 
                    introduction to Ramakrishna occurred in a literature class at General Assembly's Institution when he heard Professor William Hastie lecturing on William 
                    Wordsworth's poem, The Excursion. While explaining the word "trance" in the poem, Hastie suggested that his students visit Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar 
                    to understand the true meaning of trance. This prompted some of his students (including Narendra) to visit Ramakrishna.
                    They probably first met personally in November 1881, though Narendra did not consider this their first meeting, and neither man mentioned this 
                    meeting later. At this time, Narendra was preparing for his upcoming F. A. examination, when Ram Chandra Datta accompanied him to Surendra Nath Mitra's, 
                    house where Ramakrishna was invited to deliver a lecture. According to Makarand Paranjape, at this meeting Ramakrishna asked young Narendra to sing. 
                    Impressed by his singing talent, he asked Narendra to come to Dakshineshwar.
                    In late 1881 or early 1882, Narendra went to Dakshineswar with two friends and met Ramakrishna. This meeting proved to be a turning point in his life.
                    Although he did not initially accept Ramakrishna as his teacher and rebelled against his ideas, he was attracted by his personality and began to 
                    frequently visit him at Dakshineswar. He initially saw Ramakrishna's ecstasies and visions as "mere figments of imagination" and "hallucinations".
                    As a member of Brahmo Samaj, he opposed idol worship, polytheism and Ramakrishna's worship of Kali. He even rejected the Advaita Vedanta of "identity 
                    with the absolute" as blasphemy and madness, and often ridiculed the idea. Narendra tested Ramakrishna, who faced his arguments patiently: "Try to see 
                    the truth from all angles", he replied. 
                    Narendra's father's sudden death in 1884 left the family bankrupt; creditors began demanding the repayment of loans, and relatives threatened to evict 
                    the family from their ancestral home. Narendra, once a son of a well-to-do family, became one of the poorest students in his college. He unsuccessfully 
                    tried to find work and questioned God's existence, but found solace in Ramakrishna and his visits to Dakshineswar increased.
                    One day, Narendra requested Ramakrishna to pray to goddess Kali for their family's financial welfare. Ramakrishna instead suggested him to go to the 
                    temple himself and pray. Following Ramakrishna's suggestion, he went to the temple thrice, but failed to pray for any kind of worldly necessities and 
                    ultimately prayed for true knowledge and devotion from the goddess. Narendra gradually grew ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God, 
                    and accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru.</p><br><br>

<p id = "fifth"><b><big>His death -</big></b> On 4 July 1902 (the day of his death), Vivekananda awoke early, went to the monastery at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. 
                    He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy of yoga to pupils, later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college 
                    in the Ramakrishna Math. At 7:00 pm Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:20 p.m. while meditating.According to 
                    his disciples, Vivekananda attained mahasamādhi; the rupture of a blood vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death. His disciples
                    believed that the rupture was due to his brahmarandhra (an opening in the crown of his head) being pierced when he attained mahasamādhi. Vivekananda 
                    fulfilled his prophecy that he would not live forty years. He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre on the bank of the Ganga in Belur, opposite
                    where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen years earlier.</p><br><br>
