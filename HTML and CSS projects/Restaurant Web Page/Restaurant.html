      <p id = "desc"><b>We love digging in at Diggin. The ambiance of this place is so inviting. This restaurant is situated right across Gargi College in Anand Lok. 
        Every detail has been taking into account in the interior designing of this place. With red brick walls, swings decorated with flowers, aesthetically appealing 
        lampposts, and flower pots. When you step inside, it feels like you have stepped into a different time era. The chicken bruschetta, zucchini fries and the 
        Diggin special pizza there are must tries.</b></p>

        <p id  = "fifth"><b>Best Indian Product - <p id = "seventh">Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to India. Given the diversity in soil, 
            climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and 
            fruits.Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and traditions.
            Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to this country. The 
            Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India. A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, 
            chillies, peanuts, and guava have become staples in many regions of India.</p></b></p>

        <p id = "sixth"><b>Best Western Product -<p id = "eight">European cuisine comprises the cuisines that originate from the various countries of Europe. The cuisines of European 
            countries are diverse, although there are some common characteristics that distinguish them from those of other regions. Compared with 
            traditional cooking of East Asia, meat is more prominent and substantial in serving size. Many dairy products are utilised in cooking. 
            There are hundreds of varieties of cheese and other fermented milk products. White wheat-flour bread has long been the prestige starch, 
            but historically, most people ate bread, flatcakes, or porridge made from rye, spelt, barley, and oats. Those better-off would also make pasta, 
            dumplings and pastries. The potato has become a major starch plant in the diet of Europeans and their diaspora since the European colonisation of
            the Americas. Maize is much less common in most European diets than it is in the Americas; however, corn meal (polenta or mămăligă) is a major
            part of the cuisine of Italy and the Balkans. Although flatbreads (especially with toppings such as pizza or tarte flambée) and rice are eaten 
            in Europe, they are only staple foods in limited areas, particularly in Southern Europe. Salads (cold dishes with uncooked or cooked vegetables, 
            sometimes with a dressing) are an integral part of European cuisine.</p></b></p>
